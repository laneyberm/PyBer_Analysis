# PyBer Rideshare Analysis by City Type

## Overview:
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the difference in PyBer traffic between different city types. Using both pandas and matplotlib, we are supposed to visualize the difference between fare price, rides, and driver count between each city type. The questions we ask ourselves are: what is the average fare price per city type, how many drivers are in each city type, and how many rides are given per city type? By using pandas data frame and matplotlib visualization tools, we can easily analyze and plot the results in a comprehensive way. Although we were not asked specifically about outliers in the challenge, the module allowed us to plot box and whisker plots to visualize potential outliers within our dataset.

## Resources:
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.10.6, Pandas 1.3.5, Matplotlib 3.5.1

## Results 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 
By replacing the math and reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaNs, we created a better analysis for the school board of the Math and Reading Test Scores. For the district, the % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing was reduced to 74.8, 85.7, and 64.9 respectfully. The % Overall passing for Thomas High School changed from 65% to 90%. Additionally, Thomas High School moved to the Top Performing School List when the ninth graders were replaced.
