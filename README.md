# PyBer Rideshare Analysis by City Type

## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

In this project, we will replace the math and reading scores for nineth graders at Thomas High School with NaNs and create a better analysis for the school board of the Math and Reading Test Scores. We will also determine how the changes to the data altered the overall analysis. We will show data filtered the scores by size of school, spending per student, and type of school. This data will help the district determine how much money should be allocated to and spent on each school. 

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python using Pandas and Matplotlib

## Results 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 
By replacing the math and reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaNs, we created a better analysis for the school board of the Math and Reading Test Scores. For the district, the % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing was reduced to 74.8, 85.7, and 64.9 respectfully. The % Overall passing for Thomas High School changed from 65% to 90%. Additionally, Thomas High School moved to the Top Performing School List when the ninth graders were replaced.
